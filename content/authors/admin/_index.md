Welcome to **Network Architechtures and Dynamics (NAD)** group, a research group lead by [Dr. Shan He](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~szh/), 
Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. 

The overall goal of our group is to develop algorithms to discover knowledge from biomedical data.  We are currently focusing on network inference and network learning algorithms and their applications to cancer. Here you can find more about us and our research.
