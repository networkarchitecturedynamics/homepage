David is a PhD student under the supervision of Dr Shan He and Professor Peter Tino. He began work on his PhD in September 2016. He is interested in machine learning, 
natural computing, neural networks and complex network analysis. 
He is currently working on using self organizing maps to detect 
communities in networks, and hopes to move onto active module identification 
and to build networks containing an information layer that can produce testable
 hypotheses. He studied his BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University 
 of Birmingham and then went on to study his MSc, focusing in particular on  evolving 
 neural networks.
