Yunpeng Liu developed a disease module extracted algorithm for biological networks. 
We have applied the algorithm to Glima progression gene expression dataset and discovered several 
new potential regulators. The [paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0086693) was published in PLOS ONE. 
You can download the [source code and R package]( http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~szh/DiME/) from the software webpage, 
where you can also find a comprehensive user guide and a sample dataset.
